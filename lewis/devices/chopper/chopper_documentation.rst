Chopper simulation
==================

This folder contains a simulated neutron chopper as it will be present
at `ESS <http://europeanspallationsource.se>`__.

Choppers at ESS are abstracted in such a way that all of them are
exposed via the same interface, regardless of manufacturer. The behavior
of this abstraction layer is modelled as a finite state machine.

The docs-directory contains an ``fsm``-file (created using the program
`qfsm <http://qfsm.sourceforge.net/>`__) which describes the state
machine. While this is still work in progress, it gives an idea of how
the choppers are going to operate internally.

There are two ways of running the chopper simulation. The first option
is to run it directly using Python, the second is to run it in a `Docker
container <https://www.docker.com/>`__. See the `toplevel
README <https://github.com/ess-dmsc/lewis/blob/master/README.md>`__
for details on installing.

Starting the Chopper
--------------------

Start using Docker:

::

    $ docker run -it dmscid/lewis chopper -p "epics: {prefix: 'SIM:'}"

If running on Windows or OSX, you will additionally need to start a
`Gateway <https://hub.docker.com/r/dmscid/epics-gateway/>`__ if you want
to communicate with the Docker container from outside of the VM.

Start using Python:

::

    $ python simulation.py chopper -p "epic: {prefix: 'SIM:'}"

The ``--`` separates arguments of the protocol adapter from the
simulation's arguments.

Interacting with the simulated chopper
--------------------------------------

The simulated chopper is exposed via a set of EPICS PVs. For a detailed
description of those, see the table of available PVs below.

To observe some available EPICS PVs in an automatically updating screen:

::

    $ watch -n 1 caget SIM:State SIM:CmdL SIM:Spd-RB SIM:Spd SIM:Phs-RB SIM:Phs SIM:ParkAng-RB SIM:ParkAng

The following series of ``caput``-commands, executed from a different
terminal, will move the chopper to the specified speed and phase:

::

    $ caput SIM:CmdS init
    $ caput SIM:Spd 100.0
    $ caput SIM:Phs 23.0
    $ caput SIM:CmdS start

It may take a while until the simulation reaches the ``phase_locked``
state.

The following PVs are available. Note that if a prefix was specified on
startup, it needs to be prepended to these:

Starred PVs are not implemented yet, but will become part of the
interface.

**Possible values for STATE** - Resting\ *: The chopper disc is resting,
the magnetic bearings are off. - Levitating*: The chopper disc is in the
process of being lifted up into stable levitation. - Delevitating\ *:
The chopper disc is in the process of being let down into the resting
state. - Accelerating: The chopper disc is accelerated to the speed
setpoint. - Phase locking: The chopper is trying to acquire a phase
lock. - Phase locked: Speed and phase are at the setpoints. - Idle: The
motor is off, the disc is rotating only via inertia. - Parking: The
chopper disc is in the process of rotating to the park position. -
Parked: The chopper disc is parked in the specified position. -
Stopping: The chopper disc is actively decelerated to speed 0. -
Stopped: The chopper disc is at speed 0. - Error*: An error has occurred
(to be specified in more detail).

The states marked with a \* are not implemented yet and are not present
in choppers which work with mechanical bearings.

**Possible values for COMMAND** - start: Speed and phase are adjusted to
match the corresponding setpoints - set\_phase: Phase is adjusted to
match the corresponding setpoint - unlock: Switch off motor, but do not
actively decelerate disc - stop: Go to velocity 0, disc remains
levitated - park: Go to velocity 0, disc remains levitated, is rotated
to PARKEDANGLE:SP - levitate\ *: Levitate disc if it's not levitated -
delevitate*: Delevitate disc if possible

The commands marked with a \* are not implemented yet. There are however
two additional commands, INIT and DEINIT. INIT takes the chopper from
the initial ``init`` state to the ``stopped`` state, DEINIT does the
opposite.
